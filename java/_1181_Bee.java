/**
 * Problem: 1181 - Bee
 * 
 * Description:
 *  In Africa there is a very special species of bee. Every year, the female bees of such species 
 *  give birth to one male bee, while the male bees give birth to one male bee and one female bee, 
 *  and then they die! Now scientists have accidentally found one "magical female bee" of such 
 *  special species to the effect that she is immortal, but still able to give birth once a year as 
 *  all the other female bees. The scientists would like to know how many bees there will be after 
 *  N years. Please write a program that helps them find the number of male bees and the total 
 *  number of all bees after N years.
 * 
 * Input specification:
 *  Each line of input contains an integer N (N â‰¥ 0). Input ends with a case where N = -1 (this 
 *  case should NOT be processed).
 * 
 * Output specification: 
 *  Each line of output should have two numbers, the first one being the number of male bees after 
 *  N years, and the second one being the total number of bees after N years. The two numbers will 
 *  not exceed 232.
 * 
 * Sample input:
 *  1
 *  3
 *  -1
 * 
 * Sample output:
 *  1 2
 *  4 7
