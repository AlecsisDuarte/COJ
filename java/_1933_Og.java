/**
 * Problem: 1933 - Og
 *
 * Description:
 *  Og is a caveman with many children, and he wants to count them all. Og counts
 *  his sons with his left hand and his daughters with his right hand. However, Og
 *  is very dumb, and canâ€™t add the two counts, so he asked you to write him a
 *  program that will do the addition.
 *
 * Input specification:
 *  The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a single
 *  line containing two integers L and R, separated by a single space, indicating
 *  respectively the number of sons and daughters (1 <= L,R <= 5). The end of
 *  input is indicated by a line containing only two zeros, separated by a single
 *  space.
 *
 * Output specification:
 *  The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a single
 *  line containing two integers L and R, separated by a single space, indicating
 *  respectively the number of sons and daughters (1 <= L,R <= 5). The end of
 *  input is indicated by a line containing only two zeros, separated by a single
 *  space.
 *
 * Sample input:
 *  2 2
 *  2 3
 *  5 5
 *  1 1
 *  0 0
 *
 * Sample output:
