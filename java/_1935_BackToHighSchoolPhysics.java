/**
 * Problem: 1935 - Back to High School Physics
 *
 * Description:
 *  A particle has initial velocity and acceleration. If its velocity after
 *  certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?
 *
 * Input specification:
 *  The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of
 *  input. These two integers denote the value of v (âˆ’100 <= v <= 100) and t (0 <=
 *  t <= 200) (t means at the time the particle gains that velocity v).
 *
 * Output specification:
 *  For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the
 *  displacement in double of that time.
 *
 * Sample input:
 *  0 0
 *  5 12
 *
 * Sample output:
 *  0
 *  120
